## Exercise 1.3 ##
There are well-known classes of problems that are intractably difficult for computers,
and other classes that are provably undecidable by any computer. Does this mean that AI is
impossible?

### Solution ###
No. This means the problems are intractible for humans as well but that heuristics exist that can be used
to generate good enough approximations of results.


## Exercise 1.4 ##
Suppose we extend Evans's ANALOGY program so that it can score 200 on a standard IQ
test. Would we then have a program more intelligent than a human? Explain

No. Intelligence is the skill of generating and applying accurate predictive models of the world
based on percepts, actions, and rewards. An IQ test focuses more on pattern recognition and state manipulation
which is only a subset of this.


## Exercise 1.8 ##
Some authors have claimed that perception and motor skills are the most important part of
intelligence, and that "higher-level" capacities are necessarily parasitic—simple add-ons to these
underlying facilities. Certainly, most of evolution and a large part of the brain have been devoted
to perception and motor skills, whereas AI has found tasks such as game playing and logical
inference to be easier, in many ways, than perceiving and acting in the real world. Do you think
that AI's traditional focus on higher-level cognitive abilities is misplaced?

### Solution ###
No. These skills are required to operate in the 'real world', but are not required to create an intelligent system.


## Exercise 1.9 ##
"Surely computers cannot be intelligent—they can only do what their programmers tell
them." Is the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?

### Solution ###
Yes, No. It just needs to be programmed in a flexible way that allows for internal decisions to alter internal functions


## Exercise 1.10 ##
"Surely animals cannot be intelligent—they can only do what their genes tell them." Is
the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?

### Solution ###
Yes, No. Brain operates in a flexible way allowing for the process described above
